Project from the JetBrains academy.

The Projekt is about essential basics of object-oriented programming: encapsulation, inheritance and polymorphism. Inheritance allowed to write code that can perform the same process but for different objects. Polymorphism helped to initiate different processes for different objects by using the same method.
